SIMULATION OF THE PLANE BOARDING STRATEGIES CREATED BY MIKOŁAJ KRUŚ AND MACIEJ FILANOWICZ
INSTRUCTIONS AND SUMMARY:
1)in order to run the simulation for each of the strategies:
	*run SeatsNumbers.py
	*open Passenger.py
	*remove hashtag in "startGame(st.Random(MATRIX),3,TRUE)" in line 221
	*place name of the startegy from one of the following (preceded by "st."):
 		Random(MATRIX)
		BackToFront(MATRIX)
	        FrontToBack(MATRIX)
		BackToFront_4GROUPS(MATRIX)
		FrontToBack_4GROUPS(MATRIX)
		WindowMiddleAisle(MATRIX)
		SteffenPerfect(MATRIX)
		SteffenModified(MATRIX)
		SteffenModified2(MATRIX) - due to an opaquely explanation we decided to build additional 				strategy where in contrary to primary strategy each passenger has previously 				imposed seat. This startegy was not taken into account while drawing plot.
	*second parameter is time of stowing bags, in order to use normal distribution copy and paste 		np.random.normal() + 4 in aforementioned place
	*last parameter is bool type which defines whether the seat shuffle is present or not
2) Experiment was done using Experiment.py according with provided task (place for answers)
3) Plot was generated using Plots.py with data provided by STATS.txt which was generated by DataToPlot.py
